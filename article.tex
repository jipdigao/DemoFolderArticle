%Describe the practice in which the problem addressed appears

    
%Describe the practical problem addressed, its significance and its causes
A major problem is that Low number of attendees at DESRIST. This problem is of particular concern as it is now well established that it can lead to Low impact \cite{Hevner2004} and Limited budget. Banquet is too expensive has been shown to be related to this problem \cite{Hevner2004}. 
    
%Summarise existing research including knowledge gaps and give an account for similar and/or alternative solutions to the problem
Existing research has tackled these causes. Hevner et al. addressed the Banquet is too expensive \cite{Hevner2004}. 
    
%Formulate goals and present Kernel theories used as a basis for the artefact design
In this work, we address 1 main cause: Banquet is too expensive. 
    
%Describe the kind of artefact that is developed or evaluated
This article presents a novel artefact
    
%Formulate research questions

    
%Summarize the contributions and their significance

      
%Overview of the research strategies and methods used
This article has followed a Design Science Research approach.
